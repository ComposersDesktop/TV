This directory provides four simple demo and test scripts, 
together with one now classic generative music example; all by Richard Orton.

In most "generative" cases scripts run for ever: stop performance using Ctrl-C.


testinput.tv:  connect a MIDI keyboard; each note event 
               is written to the console (channel, pitch, velocity) 
               using the "probe" rule.

simpleout.tv:  check MIDI OUT function - connect to any 
               MIDI synth. Plays a single note repeatedly.

randomvoice.tv: also to test MIDI OUT using a synth; 
                step randomly through all available synth voices/patches.

csscotmpl.tv: template script to generate a Csound score file.
              An example of a script that terminates.

chords3.tv:   generative music from Richard Orton. Uses the text data file "intvls".
